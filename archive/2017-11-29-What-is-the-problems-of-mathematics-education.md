What is the problems of mathematics education? Mr. Courant has his reasons.

## PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

### What is the role of mathematics in the development of intellectual equipment of every cultured person in history? 

It has been regarded as an indispensable part for two thousand years. Today the traditional place of mathematics in education is in grave danger.

### Why does professional representatives of mathematics share in the responsibility of the dangerous condition?

1. The teaching of mathematics has sometimes degenerated into empty drill in problem solving, which may develop formal ability but does not lead to real understanding or to greater intellectual independence. 
2. Mathematical research has shown a tendency toward overspecialization and overemphasis on abstraction. 
3. Applications and connections with other fields have been neglected.

### What is the reactions under the dangerous condition of mathematics?

However, such conditions do not in the least justify a policy of retrenchment. On the contrary, the opposite reaction must and does arise from those who are aware of the value of intellectual discipline.
