I have luckily chosen a MIT MOOC, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python", whick started at 2017-09-01, last Friday. The book "Think Python" that I had just finished reading the first time was written by Allen Downey, who graduated from MIT. Allen's style is to my favor and I admire MIT's opencourse. Here is my answers and reasons to the entrance survey. I want to take this course seriously and participate actively.

Extremely important reasons for me in choosing to enroll in this course are two points.

1. I am major in ME, and have experience in equipment design, assembly and maintain. I know that in IT field, there are interesting things happening for a long time. So I want to access learning opportunities not otherwise available to me, such as thinking style in networks and big data.
2. I suppose myself living for the next seventy years, and believe that engaging in lifelong learning is necessary. I like learning new things, but I don't think I am sufficiently good at it. Computer Science is a new topic for me and I think it is wise to get instructions from professors for newbies like me.

Very important items are here.

1. My formal education might be out of date, such as mechanical drawing with pencil and rulers. I would like to advanced it with new techs and accomplish new task, such as contributing to FreeCAD community.
2. I have just finished reading  Prof. Downey's *[Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)* the first time, with [notes](https://john-qu.github.io/learn-to-think-python) taking in my native language. To be honest, I don't think I have diggest enough out of every word from it, with the pace of one chapter per day. I want to go back and step sound on this base fact of computational concepts, and python snippets. This  course [content](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/4f4937cb6897f9063c8a7a8eeecc367c/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2017_2+type@asset+block/6001x_syllabus.pdf) is right there for me.
3. I heard from Xiaolai Li that learning is communicating, so a better self-learning asks a better community on line worldwide.
4. My community is a running club for seven years and former colleagues in equipment manufacturing industry. To better serve them, I would like to accomplish something they want but cannot.

I want to participate commpletely but I don't promise I will complete all the assessments. May be I will jump some of them the first time.

No problem, except writing in English...

I would like to spend every morning's 3 hour and weekends' 3 hour if necessary.

I have finished *Think Python*, that means somewhat familiar, isn't it?

I was eager to reform some of my friend in high school. But, the results were not very good, to be honest.

My mother is high school and my father have participated in Liaoning University's Economics degree while working. They are loving and caring, but they are not wise at reading and critical thinking, sorry to say.

My grammar is a little broken, and my vocabulary is not large.

I had been in manufacturing, and I would be most likely to work in technical service.

These industry field names are a little misterious for me. Are they all there? Everybody can find place in this map?

A litter owner-operator, who work for himself.

I want to earn a certification, enough of weight, to enter the group of programmers and then the group of hackers.

Dear John in 2019:

This is your first chance of choosing what you would like to learn and do. Congratulations! You have completed this course in the hard way. Now you not only have the confidence to talk to other programmers but also willing to challenge other goals in life. It is a sound step toward a hacker's style of life. Hope you and your wife both appreciate this choice. and your friends enjoy your works.

I will watch videos Tuesday and Wednesday morning as the first issue, complete the reading material on Thursday, and make sure assignment finished on Friday or weekends.

I will use the lessons learned from the book "A Mind for Numbers", and focus on thinking and rethinking pattern in order to learn to think better through this course.

I will publish the learning note on my personal git hub page to announce that I have complete the required course work. If necessary, I would like to apply for certification.

I will participate in class discussion to help others and myself. I have a few friends who are major in CS. They said it would be hard to turn to CS from ME but they would like to offer advise and learning material if asked.

I will try my best in this course, but I also want to apply this ability in my life project. So the aim is 87 score.

Let me go, on the road.
