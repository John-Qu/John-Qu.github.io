I would like to use the skills learned from Mr. Adler and Mr. Van Doren's book *How to Read A Book* while rereading this book in the next five days, which means quite an endurance for me, because of both my ableless and laziness. (Totally 68 words now)

## Am I am active reader?

Honestly, No, becoming worse along with ages.

I read children's encyclopedia for information at elementary school to compete with classmate friends. Then I read science friction for curiosity. And I read biographies to be self pride at middle school, and  read hero friction for excaping from school and family noises. I read Mr. Jin's Kongfu frictions for entertainment at college, and read a lot methods books at graduate school for kiding myself.
