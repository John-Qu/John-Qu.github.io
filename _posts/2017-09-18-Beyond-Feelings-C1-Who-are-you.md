This note is taken when reading and thinking Chapter 1 Who Are You? In *Beyond Feelings*.

## What is the first step in mastering an activity?

> Anyone who wishes to master an activity must first understand its tools and rules. This is true of critical thinking as it is of golf, carpentry, flying a plane, or brain surgery. In critical thinking, however, the tools are not material objects but concepts, and the rules govern mental rather than physical performance.

## Is there any point to examining those concepts so familiar to us?

> The anwser is yes,, for three reasons. 
>
> First, much of what is commonly believed about these concepts is mistaken.
>
> Second, who ever examines them carefully is always rewarded with fresh insights.
>
> Third, the more thorough your knowledge of these concepts, the more proficient you will be in your thinking.

In short, harmful, beneficial, endless interesting.

### How to answer "Who are you?"

> To be complete, it would have to include all your characteristics - not only the physical but also the emotional and intellectual.
>
> To provide all that information would be quite a chore.

But if he is still curious about how you become this state, you might answer naturally: "I choose what I am".

But

> That answer is natural enough, and in part it's true. But in a larger sense, it's not true. The impact of the world on all of us is much greater than most of us realize.

## The Influence of Time and Place

### Where are we stand, in time and place?

> Not only are you a member of a particular species, *Homo sapiens*, but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that species and in a particular place on the planet. 
>
> That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns.

### What about living in America in colonial times, facing the practice of barring women?

### What about living in the nineteenth century, facing teenagers education, working, and adolescence?

### What about standing distances in Middle East?

### What about Indian's spouse?

### What about the confusions in Spanish and English?

### What about the ideas of punctuality in Europe, Asia, or South America?

> As Daniel Goleman explains, “Five minutes is late but permissible for a business appointment in the U.S., but thirty minutes is normal in Arab countries. In England five to fifteen minutes is the ‘correct’ lateness for one invited to dinner; an Italian might come two hours late, an Ethiopian still later, a Javanese not at all, having accepted only to prevent his host’s losing face.”

### What about different tastes in food in different ethnic origins?

> Sociologist Ian Robertson summed up the range of global dietary differences succinctly: “Americans eat oysters but not snails. The French eat snails but not lo- custs. The Zulus eat locusts but not fish. The Jews eat fish but not pork. The Hindus eat pork but not beef. The Russians eat beef but not snakes. The Chinese eat snakes but not people. The Jalé of New Guinea find people delicious.”5 [Note: The reference to Hindus is mistaken.]

### What if I rebelled against the values of my time and place?

They still represent the context of your life - in other words, they still would influence you responses.

## The Influece of Ideas

### What are the two types of idea influence?

1. Meanings, *sequitur*, "it follows". This is related idea.

   e.g.. Believe in yourself, succeed in anything.

2. Implications. This is other idea.

   e.g.. no real difference between virtue and vice, why let us count our spoons.

### Why cannot we be fully aware of the closely linked meanings and implications of the ideas we encounter?

> Because in many cases, we take ideas at face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associated meanings and implications.

e.g.. "intelligence is genetically determined and cannot be increased"

#### How did educators, legislators, Eugenicists, and business leaders viewed and make practices with this idea?

#### What about other effects of hereditarianism? 

* discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities

* Often-paternalistic policies of government offered in responce
