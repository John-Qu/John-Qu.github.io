## What aspects do you feel excited in learning?

> **7322** words submitted in total.
>
> Your words were:
>
> - **thinking** 1% - Work with mind, exercising!
> - **accomplishment** 0% - I can accomplish my dream function!
> - **help** 0% - I can help my friends!
> - **better mind** 0% - My mind becomes better and better, and that's awosome!
> - **sence** 0% - I would have a good sence of beauty.

## Is it on a par with the course offered on campus at MIT?

> > `On a par`: at the same level or standard as (someone or something else) *The new version of the software is on a par with the old one.* *His new book is on par with his best sellers.*
> >
> > As good as, equal to, as in *This violinist may be an amateur but he's on a par with professional orchestral players.* The noun parhas meant “that which is equal” since the mid-1600s; the idiom here was first recorded in 1832. 

The answer is "Yes". 

> From the beginning, the creators of this course wanted to offer a MITx course through edX that is on par with the "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming" offered on campus at MIT.

So

> **This is a hard course. It is easy to get discouraged, but don't!**

In order to successfully complete all parts, I have to:

> * Understand the relevant subtleties of the Python language
> * critically think about the approaches to solve the problem
> * have good time management skills
> * pay close attention to deadlines
>
> > `subtlety`:
> >
> > * 1 U 巧妙(さ), 上手さ; 鋭敏(さ), 鋭い感受性[洞察力].
> > * 2 C〖通例-ties〗(隠れた重要な)細部, 微細, 機微.

## What could distinguish this one from other introduction courses?

No.1: accelerated pace

No.2: focus on students critically thinking about problems

By: stress practice as a very important part of learning.

Highly encourage: 

> Start early and do little bits of exercise every day, (during lunch breaks, 10 mins of goofing around on the Python shell every now and then, taking a piece of pager and a pen to your kid's soccer game, whatsoever), the material starts to seep in.
>
> > `seep in`:a brown substance is seeping into the basement: OOZE, trickle, exude, drip, dribble, flow, issue, escape, leak, drain, bleed, filter, percolate, soak.

## Will this course be offered again?

Yes.

> - Then if you try the next offering again, with the knowledge you gained this time, you will conquer this course with more ease.

If it is too tough, less rewarding sense. But too much rewarding sence, less learned and changed.

> Students and staff alike, we all want to make this an AWESOME computer science course! **By the n-th iteration**, we will surely have reached a good balance of tough and rewarding!

There will be a n-th iteration.

## What is origin goal of this course on campus?

[source page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/Syllabus/)

> Let's start with the strategic goals of this course:
>
> - Help students (who may or may not intend to major in computer science) to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs.
> - Map scientific problems into computational frameworks.
> - Position students so that they can compete for jobs by providing competence and confidence in computational problem solving.
> - Prepare college freshmen and sophomores who have no prior programming experience or knowledge of computer science for an easier entry into computer science or electrical engineering majors.
> - Prepare students from other majors to make profitable use of computational methods in their chosen field.

That means:

* Everyone should be able to solve problems in computational framework with programming skills.
* One run for job can gain competence and confidence here.
* One major in CS of EE can find easier entry here.
* One major in other field can make benefits from computational methods.

## What is the topics or objectives?

> 6.00SC can be summarized with these six major topics or objectives:
>
> 1. Learning a language for expressing computations—Python
> 2. Learning about the process of writing and debugging a program
> 3. Learning about the process of moving from a problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem
> 4. Learning a basic set of "recipes"—algorithms
> 5. Learning how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don't easily succumb to closed form solutions
> 6. Learning about how to use computational tools to help model and understand data

## Why all exams are open book?

> 6.00 is designed to help you become skillful at making the computer do what you want it to do. Once you acquire this skill, your first instinct when confronted with many tasks will be to write a program to do the task for you. Said another way, we want  
>
> * to help you learn to apply computational modes of thought to frame problems, and 
> * to guide the process of deducing information in a computational manner.
>
> This means that the primary knowledge you will take away from this course is the art of computational problem solving. Unlike many introductory level courses, having an ability to memorize facts will be of little help in 6.00. This course is about learning to solve problems, not learning facts. (This, by the way, is exactly why all exams are open book.)

## What is the prerequisites and preparation?

>  This course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience but a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Now, by definition, none of you are under-qualified for this course. 
>
> In terms of being over-qualified — if you have a lot of prior programming experience, we really don't want you wasting your time, and in this case we would suggest that you talk to me about how well this class suits your needs, and to discuss other options. 
>
> In addition, we want to maintain a productive educational environment, and thus we don't want over-qualified students making other students feel **inadequate**, when in fact they are only **inexperienced**.
>
> Since computer programming involves computational modes of thinking, it will help to have some mathematical and logical aptitude. You should be confident with your math skills up to pre-calculus.
>
> > `aptitude`noun
> >
> > an aptitude for higher mathematics: TALENT, gift, flair, bent, skill, knack, facility, ability, proficiency, capability, potential, capacity, faculty, genius.

## What about the Professor?

Now this course [is taught](https://www.edx.org/bio/eric-grimson) by [Eric Grimson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Grimson), who graduate from Canada in 1975 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and physics. In 1980, he received his PhD in mathematics from MIT.
