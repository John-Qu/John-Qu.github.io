## Who are the students this course aimed at?

> This course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving.

Which means:

* They are not major in CS, because students who applies for CS mostly or entirely have prior experience with programming in high school even in elementary school.

  Me too.

* They have other interests, because students who are accepted by MIT mostly or entirely are eccentric somehow, time that not spend on programming must have been pound on other activities.

  Me too. Ur…, on superficial reading stories.

* They commit that computational approaches can and must be used to help problem solving, otherwise they don't need to be in this course.

  I want to solve the B-spline CAM curve problem.

## What if the students have finished this course?

> Each year, a few of the students in the class use the course as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses. But for most of the students it will be their only computer science course.

In fact, they have their own major course. Only a few of them choose to take more advanced course in CS.

> The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what’s possible when the time comes to think about how to use computation to accomplish a goal. That said, it is not a “computation appreciation” course. It is a challenging and rigorous course in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to **bend the computer** to their will.

The keywords is "possible", "appreciation" and "bend".

* Possible: no known, no possibility, not really known, no use.
* Appreciation vs Bend, not to know what computation can help and admire it, but to let this tall man bend his back and word for host's will.  

## What if the students have finished this book?

> The main goal of this book is to help you, the reader, become skillful at making productive use of computational techniques. 
>
> You should learn
>
> - to apply computational modes of thoughts to frame problems and 
> - to guide the process of extracting information from data in a computational manner. 
>
> The primary knowledge you will take away from this book is the art of computational problem solving.

Ask myself: 

* To become skillful at making productive use of computational techniques, is my goal, isn't it?
* What is my mode of thinking in framing problem? Is it computational?
* How to guild the process of extracting information from data? What is the compuatational manner?
* Did I get the primary gem after finishing this page, this chapter and this book? What is it, art of compuational problem solving? Knowing the rules and Using them as habit?

## Is there an easier way to learn programming?

> Programming is an intrinsically difficult activity. Just as “there is no royal road to geometry,” There is no royal road to programming. 
>
> It is possible to deceive students into thinking that they have learned how to program by having them complete a series of highly constrained “fill in the blank” programming problems. 
>
> However, this does not prepare students for figuring out how to harness computational thinking to solve problems.

Fill in the blank, repeat the action, not worry about copying, they are deceive to oneself.

To harness particular thinking to particular actions, there is no royal road. One must read the information, run the examples, and practice the exercises.

## Who helped John Guttag make this course and book available?

Eric Grimson,  who is MIT's Chancellor at that time, managed to find the time to read almost the entire book, found errors, pointed out places where necessary explanations were missing.

Chris Terman, read and point out errors.

David Guttag, his son might be, overcame his aversion to computer science, and proofread some chapters.

Also, teaching assistants, and students, helped a lot.

## What aspects do you feel excited in learning?

> **7322** words submitted in total.
>
> Your words were:
>
> - **thinking** 1% - Work with mind, exercising!
> - **accomplishment** 0% - I can accomplish my dream function!
> - **help** 0% - I can help my friends!
> - **better mind** 0% - My mind becomes better and better, and that's awosome!
> - **sence** 0% - I would have a good sence of beauty.

## Is it on a par with the course offered on campus at MIT?

> > `On a par`: at the same level or standard as (someone or something else) *The new version of the software is on a par with the old one.* *His new book is on par with his best sellers.*
> >
> > As good as, equal to, as in *This violinist may be an amateur but he's on a par with professional orchestral players.* The noun parhas meant “that which is equal” since the mid-1600s; the idiom here was first recorded in 1832. 

The answer is "Yes". 

> From the beginning, the creators of this course wanted to offer a MITx course through edX that is on par with the "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming" offered on campus at MIT.

So

> **This is a hard course. It is easy to get discouraged, but don't!**

In order to successfully complete all parts, I have to:

> * Understand the relevant subtleties of the Python language
> * critically think about the approaches to solve the problem
> * have good time management skills
> * pay close attention to deadlines
>
> > `subtlety`:
> >
> > * 1 U 巧妙(さ), 上手さ; 鋭敏(さ), 鋭い感受性[洞察力].
> > * 2 C〖通例-ties〗(隠れた重要な)細部, 微細, 機微.

## What could distinguish this one from other introduction courses?

No.1: accelerated pace

No.2: focus on students critically thinking about problems

By: stress practice as a very important part of learning.

Highly encourage: 

> Start early and do little bits of exercise every day, (during lunch breaks, 10 mins of goofing around on the Python shell every now and then, taking a piece of pager and a pen to your kid's soccer game, whatsoever), the material starts to seep in.
>
> > `seep in`:a brown substance is seeping into the basement: OOZE, trickle, exude, drip, dribble, flow, issue, escape, leak, drain, bleed, filter, percolate, soak.

## Will this course be offered again?

Yes.

> - Then if you try the next offering again, with the knowledge you gained this time, you will conquer this course with more ease.

If it is too tough, less rewarding sense. But too much rewarding sence, less learned and changed.

> Students and staff alike, we all want to make this an AWESOME computer science course! **By the n-th iteration**, we will surely have reached a good balance of tough and rewarding!

There will be a n-th iteration.

## What is origin goal of this course on campus?

[source page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/Syllabus/)

> Let's start with the strategic goals of this course:
>
> - Help students (who may or may not intend to major in computer science) to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs.
> - Map scientific problems into computational frameworks.
> - Position students so that they can compete for jobs by providing competence and confidence in computational problem solving.
> - Prepare college freshmen and sophomores who have no prior programming experience or knowledge of computer science for an easier entry into computer science or electrical engineering majors.
> - Prepare students from other majors to make profitable use of computational methods in their chosen field.

That means:

* Everyone should be able to solve problems in computational framework with programming skills.
* One run for job can gain competence and confidence here.
* One major in CS of EE can find easier entry here.
* One major in other field can make benefits from computational methods.

## ~~What is the topics or objectives?~~

> ~~6.00SC can be summarized with these six major topics or objectives:~~
>
> 1. ~~Learning a language for expressing computations—Python~~
> 2. ~~Learning about the process of writing and debugging a program~~
> 3. ~~Learning about the process of moving from a problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem~~
> 4. ~~Learning a basic set of "recipes"—algorithms~~
> 5. ~~Learning how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don't easily succumb to closed form solutions~~
> 6. ~~Learning about how to use computational tools to help model and understand data~~

## What have learned when finish this book?

2017-09-11

> The book has two pervasive themes: systematic problem solving and the powerof abstraction. When you have finished this book you should have:
>
> - Learned a language, Python, for expressing computations,
>
> - Learned a systematic approach to organizing, writing and debugging
>
>   medium-sized programs,
>
> - Developed an informal understanding of computational complexity,
>
> - Developed some insight into the process of moving from an ambiguousproblem statement to a computational formulation of a method forsolving the problem,
>
> - Learned a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques,
>
> - Learned how to use randomness and simulations to shed light on
>
>   problems that don’t easily succumb to closed-form solutions, and
>
> - Learned how to use computational tools, including simple statistical andvisualization tools, to model and understand data.

## Why all exams are open book?

> 6.00 is designed to help you become skillful at making the computer do what you want it to do. Once you acquire this skill, your first instinct when confronted with many tasks will be to write a program to do the task for you. Said another way, we want  
>
> * to help you learn to apply computational modes of thought to frame problems, and 
> * to guide the process of deducing information in a computational manner.
>
> This means that the primary knowledge you will take away from this course is the art of computational problem solving. Unlike many introductory level courses, having an ability to memorize facts will be of little help in 6.00. This course is about learning to solve problems, not learning facts. (This, by the way, is exactly why all exams are open book.)

## What is the prerequisites and preparation?

>  This course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience but a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Now, by definition, none of you are under-qualified for this course. 
>
>  In terms of being over-qualified — if you have a lot of prior programming experience, we really don't want you wasting your time, and in this case we would suggest that you talk to me about how well this class suits your needs, and to discuss other options. 
>
>  In addition, we want to maintain a productive educational environment, and thus we don't want over-qualified students making other students feel **inadequate**, when in fact they are only **inexperienced**.
>
>  Since computer programming involves computational modes of thinking, it will help to have some mathematical and logical aptitude. You should be confident with your math skills up to pre-calculus.
>
>  > `aptitude`noun
>  >
>  > an aptitude for higher mathematics: TALENT, gift, flair, bent, skill, knack, facility, ability, proficiency, capability, potential, capacity, faculty, genius.

## What about the Professor?

Now this course [is taught](https://www.edx.org/bio/eric-grimson) by [Eric Grimson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Grimson), who graduate from Canada in 1975 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and physics. In 1980, he received his PhD in mathematics from MIT.
