I have started to read *What is Mathematics - An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods*  for three days. I would like to remember what I have learned, and mark what I have done in the exercises.

## INTRODUCTION

### What is the basis of modern mathematics?

It is number, more concisely, positive integers - the natural numbers. 

We have learned the mechanics of handling fractions and negative numbers in elemenary school, but what dose it mean to say that
$$
\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2}  \doteq 1,\  \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}, \ and \ (-1)(-1) = 1\  ?
$$
If we want to get a real understand, we should go to more elementary elements.

> While the Greeks chose the geometrical concepts of point and line as the basis of their mathematics, it has become the modem guiding principle that all mathematical statements should be reducible ultimately to statements about the natural numbers , 1, 2, 3, … .

It is a "should be", whick means a point of view.

> "God created the natual numbers; everything else is man's handiwork."

> — [Leopold Kronecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker) 
>
> > handiwork noun
> >
> > the dressmakers stood back to survey their handiwork: 
> >
> > creation, product, work, achievement; handicraft, craft, craftwork.

However, it has argument in this point of view. It seems that others take set theory as the basis of modern mathematics.

> He criticized [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor)'s work on [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and was quoted by [Weber (1893)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker#CITEREFWeber1893)as having said, "*Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk*" ("God made the integers, all else is the work of man.").

**[Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory)** devoted primarily to the study of the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer). It might be doubted to be called "The Queen of Mathematics" because of its foundational place in the discipline. But it is indeed natural to understand mathematics.

### What stage of intellectual can understand the abstract character of the idea of numbers?

> Only at a rather advanced stage of intellectual development does the abstract character of the idea of number become clear. 
>
> To children, numbers always re- main connected with tangible objects such as fingers or beads, and primi- tive languages display a concrete number sense by providing different sets of number words for different types of objects.

数数，数的是东西，用的是语言。但是，自然数的意义与具体物和语言没有关系。

> Fortunately, the mathematician as such need not be concerned with the philosophical nature of the transition from collections of concrete objects to the abstract number concept. We shall therefore accept the natural numbers as given, together with the two fundamental operations, addition and multiplication, by which they may be combined.

类似于公理，假设，前提，不需要用更基本的概念来证明。自然数，及其加法和乘法，是自然届的基本事实。

#### As such

“as such 作“像这样的人、事、物”、“作为这样的人、事、物”、“以 … 资格、名义、身份“、“因而”讲。

We agree to the plan as such. 我们同意像这样的计划。
He is an old worker, and is respected as such. 他是一位老工人, 因而受到尊敬。（或译为：受到老工人应该受到的尊敬。）”

## CALCULATION WITH INTEGERS

### How to describe the using of specific integer and generality of laws?

> In order to state these laws in full generality we cannot use symbols like 1, 2, 3 which refer to specific integers. The statement
> $$
>  1 + 2 = 2 + 1
> $$
>  is only a particular instance of the general law that the sum of two integers is the same regardless of the order in which they are considered. Hence, when we wish to express the fact that a certain relation between integers is valid irrespective of the values of the particular integers involved, we shall **denote** integers symbolically by letters a, b, c, • .

### irrespective

adjective

each member has one vote, irrespective of the number of shares held:

 regardless of, without regard to/for, notwithstanding, whatever, no matter what, without consideration of.

### denote 

verb

1 the headdresses denoted warriors: 

designate, indicate, be a mark of, signify, signal, symbolize, represent, mean; typify, characterize, distinguish, mark, identify.

2 his manner denoted an inner strength: 

suggest, point to, smack of, indicate, show, reveal, intimate, imply, convey, betray, bespeak, spell.

CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD connote, denote

Denote refers to the literal, primary meaning of something; connote refers to other characteristics suggested or implied by that thing. Thus, one might say that the word 'mother' denotes ‘a woman who is a parent’ but connotes qualities such as 'protection' and 'affection.' Connotate is a needless variant of connote that, if anything, only adds to the confusion, and therefore should be avoided.

### How to describe the five fundamental law of arithmetic?

> 1) a + b = b + a, 2) ab = ba,
>
> 3) a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, 4) a(bc) =(ab)c,
>
> 5) a(b + c) = ab + ac.
>
> The first two of these, the commutative laws of addition and multipli- cation, state that one may interchange the order of the elements involved in addition or multiplication. 
>
> The third, the associative law of addition, states that addition of three numbers gives the same result whether we add to the first the sum of the second and third, or to the third the sum of the first and second. 
>
> The fourth is the associative law of multiplication. 
>
> The last, the distributive law, expresses the fact that to multiply a sum by an integer we may multiply each term of the sum by this integer and then add the products.

The fourth, the associative law of multiplication, states that multiplication of three numbers gives the same result whether we multiply to the first the product of the second and third, or to the third the product of the first and second.

### Might the commutative, associative, and distributive laws be applicable to entities other than integers?

As less not for chemical substances.

> If a and b are symbols not for integers but for chemical substances, and if “addition” is used in a colloquial sense, it is evident that the commutative law will not always hold. 
>
> For example, if **sulphuric** acid is added to water, a dilute solution is obtained, while the addition of water to pure sulphuric acid may result in disaster to the experimenter. Similar illustrations will show that in this type of chemical “arithmetic” the associative and distributive laws of addition may also fail.
>
> > sulfuric |səlˈfyo͞orik| (chiefly British also sulphuric) adjective
> >
> > containing sulfur or sulfuric acid: 
> >
> > the sulfuric byproducts of wood fires.

Can I give another circumstance in which one or more of the three arithmetic laws do not hold?

### Is there a concrete model for the abstract concept of integer to indicate the intuitive basis on which the law 1)-5) rest?

a set of dots placed in a rectangular box, one dot for each object

> Geometrical models like these boxes of dots, such as the ancient abacus, were widely used for numerical calculations until late in the middle ages, when they were slowly displaced by greatly superior symbolic methods based on the decimal system.

### How do we define the relation of inequality and the operation of subtraction with the definition of equality and addition?

> Each of the equivalent statements, a < b and b > a, means that box b may be obtained from box a by the addition of a properly chosen third box c, so that b = a + c.
>
> When this is so we write
>
> c = b - a,
>
> which defines the operation of subtraction.

## What is inverse operations in arithmetic?

Addition and subtraction are said to be inverse operations.

(a + d) - d = a

But multiplication and division is not inverse operations.

### What are the characteristic arithmetical properties of zero?

a + 0 = a,

a*0 = 0,

a - a = 0
