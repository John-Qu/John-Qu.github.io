I have started to read *What is Mathematics - An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods*  for three days. I would like to remember what I have learned, and mark what I have done in the exercises.

## INTRODUCTION

### What is the basis of modern mathematics?

It is number, more concisely, positive integers - the natural numbers. 

We have learned the mechanics of handling fractions and negative numbers in elemenary school, but what dose it mean to say that
$$
\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2}  \doteq 1,\  \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}, \ and \ (-1)(-1) = 1\  ?
$$
If we want to get a real understand, we should go to more elementary elements.

> While the Greeks chose the geometrical concepts of point and line as the basis of their mathematics, it has become the modem guiding principle that all mathematical statements should be reducible ultimately to statements about the natural numbers , 1, 2, 3, … .

It is a "should be", whick means a point of view.

> "God created the natual numbers; everything else is man's handiwork."
>
> — [Leopold Kronecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker) 
>
> > handiwork noun
> >
> > the dressmakers stood back to survey their handiwork: 
> >
> > creation, product, work, achievement; handicraft, craft, craftwork.

However, it has argument in this point of view. It seems that others take set theory as the basis of modern mathematics.

> He criticized [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor)'s work on [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and was quoted by [Weber (1893)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker#CITEREFWeber1893)as having said, "*Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk*" ("God made the integers, all else is the work of man.").

**[Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory)** devoted primarily to the study of the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer). It might be doubted to be called "The Queen of Mathematics" because of its foundational place in the discipline. But it is indeed natural to understand mathematics.

### What stage of intellectual can understand the abstract character of the idea of numbers?

> Only at a rather advanced stage of intellectual development does the abstract character of the idea of number become clear. 
>
> To children, numbers always re- main connected with tangible objects such as fingers or beads, and primi- tive languages display a concrete number sense by providing different sets of number words for different types of objects.

数数，数的是东西，用的是语言。但是，自然数的意义与具体物和语言没有关系。

> Fortunately, the mathematician as such need not be concerned with the philosophical nature of the transition from collections of concrete objects to the abstract number concept. We shall therefore accept the natural numbers as given, together with the two fundamental operations, addition and multiplication, by which they may be combined.

类似于公理，假设，前提，不需要用更基本的概念来证明。自然数，及其加法和乘法，是自然届的基本事实。

#### As such

“as such 作“像这样的人、事、物”、“作为这样的人、事、物”、“以 … 资格、名义、身份“、“因而”讲。

We agree to the plan as such. 我们同意像这样的计划。
He is an old worker, and is respected as such. 他是一位老工人, 因而受到尊敬。（或译为：受到老工人应该受到的尊敬。）”

## 1. CALCULATION WITH INTEGERS

### How to describe the using of specific integer and generality of laws?

> In order to state these laws in full generality we cannot use symbols like 1, 2, 3 which refer to specific integers. The statement
> $$
>  1 + 2 = 2 + 1
> $$
>  is only a particular instance of the general law that the sum of two integers is the same regardless of the order in which they are considered. Hence, when we wish to express the fact that a certain relation between integers is valid irrespective of the values of the particular integers involved, we shall **denote** integers symbolically by letters a, b, c, • .

### irrespective

adjective

each member has one vote, irrespective of the number of shares held:

 regardless of, without regard to/for, notwithstanding, whatever, no matter what, without consideration of.

### denote 

verb

1 the headdresses denoted warriors: 

designate, indicate, be a mark of, signify, signal, symbolize, represent, mean; typify, characterize, distinguish, mark, identify.

2 his manner denoted an inner strength: 

suggest, point to, smack of, indicate, show, reveal, intimate, imply, convey, betray, bespeak, spell.

CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD connote, denote

Denote refers to the literal, primary meaning of something; connote refers to other characteristics suggested or implied by that thing. Thus, one might say that the word 'mother' denotes ‘a woman who is a parent’ but connotes qualities such as 'protection' and 'affection.' Connotate is a needless variant of connote that, if anything, only adds to the confusion, and therefore should be avoided.

### How to describe the five fundamental law of arithmetic?

> 1) a + b = b + a, 2) ab = ba,
>
> 3) a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, 4) a(bc) =(ab)c,
>
> 5) a(b + c) = ab + ac.
>
> The first two of these, the commutative laws of addition and multipli- cation, state that one may interchange the order of the elements involved in addition or multiplication. 
>
> The third, the associative law of addition, states that addition of three numbers gives the same result whether we add to the first the sum of the second and third, or to the third the sum of the first and second. 
>
> The fourth is the associative law of multiplication. 
>
> The last, the distributive law, expresses the fact that to multiply a sum by an integer we may multiply each term of the sum by this integer and then add the products.

The fourth, the associative law of multiplication, states that multiplication of three numbers gives the same result whether we multiply to the first the product of the second and third, or to the third the product of the first and second.

### Might the commutative, associative, and distributive laws be applicable to entities other than integers?

As less not for chemical substances.

> If a and b are symbols not for integers but for chemical substances, and if “addition” is used in a colloquial sense, it is evident that the commutative law will not always hold. 
>
> For example, if **sulphuric** acid is added to water, a dilute solution is obtained, while the addition of water to pure sulphuric acid may result in disaster to the experimenter. Similar illustrations will show that in this type of chemical “arithmetic” the associative and distributive laws of addition may also fail.
>
> > sulfuric |səlˈfyo͞orik| (chiefly British also sulphuric) adjective
> >
> > containing sulfur or sulfuric acid: 
> >
> > the sulfuric byproducts of wood fires.

Can I give another circumstance in which one or more of the three arithmetic laws do not hold?

### Is there a concrete model for the abstract concept of integer to indicate the intuitive basis on which the law 1)-5) rest?

a set of dots placed in a rectangular box, one dot for each object

![](https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fku3l2hbi6j30sc05cwf3.jpg)

![](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fku3l2ckqej30mu09sdgq.jpg)

![](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fku3l2742vj30xa076wfo.jpg)

> Geometrical models like these boxes of dots, such as the ancient abacus, were widely used for numerical calculations until late in the middle ages, when they were slowly displaced by greatly superior symbolic methods based on the decimal system.

### How do we define the relation of inequality and the operation of subtraction with the definition of equality and addition?

> Each of the equivalent statements, a < b and b > a, means that box b may be obtained from box a by the addition of a properly chosen third box c, so that b = a + c.
>
> When this is so we write
>
> c = b - a,
>
> which defines the operation of subtraction.

## What is inverse operations in arithmetic?

Addition and subtraction are said to be inverse operations.

(a + d) - d = a

But multiplication and division is not inverse operations.

### What are the characteristic arithmetical properties of zero?

a + 0 = a,

a*0 = 0,

a - a = 0

### How to represent integer with symbols? Is it natural to do this way?

> We must carefully distinguish between an integer and the symbol, 5, V, • . * , etc., used to represent it.

It is not natural this way.

### For large integers, how to resprenet them?

> The general rule is to express an integer in the form illustrated by
>
> ![](https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1fkwejcltobj3168026weu.jpg)

> > he mentioned in passing that you had a lot of female visitors: incidentally, by the by, by the way, as it happens, in the course of conversation, en passant, parenthetically.
> >
> > briefly and casually: the research was mentioned only in passing.

### Can you realize that the selection of ten as base is not essential?

> In the decimal system the number ten is singled out to serve as a base. The *layman* may not realize that the selection of ten is not essential, and that any integer greater than one would serve the same purpose.
>
> For examnle. a senltynal svstem (base 71 could he used. TMIn such a systern, an integer would be expressed as

### What is the important point in this positional notation?

> Here the important point is that the meaning of the digit symbols 3, 7, 2 depends on their position in the units, tens, or hundreds place. With this “positional notation” we can represent any integer by using only the ten digit symbols in various combinations.

> The invention of positionq.1 notation, attributed to the Sumerians or Babylonians and developed by the Hindus, was of enormous significance for civilization. Early systems of numeration were based on a purely additive principle. In the Roman symbolism, for example, one wrote![](https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1fkwf6kqqy4j314o020t9f.jpg)
>
> The Egyptian, Hebrew, and Greek systems of numeration were on the same level. 
>
> One disadvantage of any purely additive notation is that more and more new symbols are needed as numbers get larger. (Of course, early scientists were not troubled by our modern astronomical oratomicmagnitudes.) But the chief faul to fancient systems, such as the Roman, was that computation with numbers was so difficult that only the specialist could handle any but the simplest problems.

### What is the agreeable property of the positional system?

> The positional system has the agreeable property that all numbers, however large or small, can be represented by the use of a small set of different digit symbols (in the decimal system, these are the ‘‘Arabic numerals” 0, 1,2, • • • ,9). 
>
> Along with this goes the more important advantage of ease of computation. The rules of *reckoning* with numbers represented in positional notation can be stated in the form of addition and multiplication tables for the digits that can be memorized once and for all. The ancient art of computation, once *confined* to a few adepts, is now taught in elementary school. There are not many instances where scientific progress has so deeply affected and facilitated everyday life.

### How dose the words of many languages show remnants of the use of other bases, notably twelve and twenty?

> In English and German the words for II and 12 are not constructed on the decimal principle of combining 10 with the digits, as are the ‘‘teens," but are linguistically independent of the words for 10. 
>
> In French the words ‘ ‘vingt” and ‘ ‘quatre- vingt" for 20 and 80 suggest that for some purposes a system with base 20 might have been used. 
>
> In Danish the word for 70, “halvfirsindstyve," means half-way (from threetimes) to fourtimes twenty. 
>
> The Babylonian astronomers had a system of notation that was partly sexagesimal (base 60), and this is believed to account for the customary division of the hour and the angular degree into 60 minutes.

### Exercise C1-1-3-1: Set up the addition and multiplication tables in the duodecimal system and work some examples of the same sort.

> Accustomed to the decimal system and tied to it by the number words of our language, we might at first find this a little confusing.

> > #### duodecimal
> >
> > ORIGIN late 17th century: from Latin duodecimus  ‘twelfth’ (from duodecim ‘twelve’) + [-al](x-dictionary:r:m_en_us1220702:com.apple.dictionary.NOAD).
> >
> > In Latin, rather than English and German, the word 12 is dependent with ten.

With this code, I have generated the additional and mutiplicational tables.

```python
def make_addition_table(b):
    ''' print out the addtion table of base b
    '''
    print("Addition Table of Base " + str(b))
    # print the head row first
    for i in range(b):
        print(tobase(i, b), end = "\t")
    print()
    # print the table
    for i in range(b-1):
        r = i + 1 # row
        # print the head column in each line
        print(tobase(r, b), end = "\t")
        for j in range(b-1):
            c = j + 1 # column
            s = r + c # sum
            print(tobase(s, b), end = "\t")
        print()
        
def make_multipication_table(b):
    ''' print out the Multiplication table of base b
    '''
    print("Multiplication Table of Base " + str(b))
    # print the head row first
    for i in range(b):
        print(tobase(i, b), end = "\t")
    print()
    for i in range(b-1):
        r = i + 1 # row
        print(tobase(r, b), end = "\t")
        for j in range(b-1):
            c = j + 1 # column
            p = r * c # product
            print(tobase(p, b), end = "\t")
        print()

def tobase(n, b):
    """ represents decimal number in base system
        input: string of decimal number, and base
        output: str of number in base
    """
    res = ""
    n = int(n)
    while True:
        mod, rem = divmod(n, b)
        if rem > 9:
            d = chr(945 + rem-10) # go along with α, β, γ...
        else:
            d = str(rem)
        res = d + res
        if mod == 0:
            break
        else:
            n = mod
    return res
```

If I multiply 2α9 with 3β, it would be

![](https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tKfTcgy1fkytx3r9ftj30av0bg74e.jpg)

To check the result, I wrote this code.

```python
def test01(x, y, xy, b):
    """ Tests x * y in base b, where
    x, y is string of number in base b
    """
    xy10 = frbase(xy, b)
    xx = frbase(x, b)
    yy = frbase(y, b)
    xxyy = str(int(xx) * int(yy))
    print(x + " * " + y + " in base " + str(b) + " is " + xy)
    print("which is " + xy10 + " in decimal system.")
    print(x + " in base" + str(b) + " is decimal " + xx + ",")
    print(y + " in base" + str(b) + " is decimal " + yy )
    print("and" + xx + " * " + yy + " in decimal is " + str(xxyy) + ".")

test01("2α9", "3β", "β413", 12)
```

It prints out:

```Shell
2α9 * 3β in base 12 is β413
which is 19599 in decimal system.
2α9 in base12 is decimal 417,
3β in base12 is decimal 47
and 417 * 47 in decimal is 19599.
```

### Exercise C1-1-3-2: Express “thirty" and “one hundred and thirty-three" in the systems with the bases 5, 7, 11, 12.

```python
def test02():
    x = "30"
    y = "133"
    l_b = [5, 7, 11, 12]
    for b in l_b:
        print(x + ", " + y + " in base " + str(b) + " is " + tobase(x, b) + ", "  + tobase(y, b))

test02()
```

```shell
30, 133 in base 5 is 110, 1013
30, 133 in base 7 is 42, 250
30, 133 in base 11 is 28, 111
30, 133 in base 12 is 26, β1
```

### Exercise C1-1-3-3: What do the symbols 11111 and 21212 mean in these systems?

```shell
11111, 21212 is 781, 1432 in base 5
11111, 21212 is 2801, 5252 in base 7
11111, 21212 is 16105, 30868 in base 11
11111, 21212 is 22621, 43502 in base 12
```



### Exercise C1-1-3-4: Form the addition and multiplication tables for the bases 5, 11, 13.

### Why is dyadic system singled out?

* It has the smallest possible base, which has only digits of 0 and 1, and every other number *z* is represented by a row of these symbols.
* The addition and multiplication tables consist merely of the rules 1 + 1 = 10 and 1·1 = 1.
* To quote Laplace: “Leibniz saw in his binary arithmetic the image of creation. He imagined that Unity represented God, and zero the void that the Supreme Being drew all beings from the void, just as unity and zero express all numbers in his system of numeration.”

### Exercise C1-1-3-5: 

Consider the question of representing integers with the base a. In order to name the integers in this system we need words for the digits 0, 1, …, a-1 and for the various powers of a: a1, a2 a3 • • • . 

How many different number words are needed to name all numbers from zero to one thousand, for a - 2, 3, 4, 5, , 15? Which base requires the fewest? 

(Examples: If a = 10, we need ten words for the digits, plus words for 10, 100, and 1000, making a total of 13. For a = 20, we need twenty w’ords for the digits, plus words for 20 and 400, making a total of 22. If a = 100, we need 100 plus 1.)

With code

```python
def test05():
    for b in range(2, 16):
        print("It needs " + str(b + len(tobase(1000 , b)) - 1) + " words in base " +str(b))

test05()
```

we get the results

```shell
It needs 11 words in base 2
It needs 9 words in base 3
It needs 8 words in base 4
It needs 9 words in base 5
It needs 9 words in base 6
It needs 10 words in base 7
It needs 11 words in base 8
It needs 12 words in base 9
It needs 13 words in base 10
It needs 13 words in base 11
It needs 14 words in base 12
It needs 15 words in base 13
It needs 16 words in base 14
It needs 17 words in base 15
```

System with base 4 requires the fewest words to name all numbers from zero to one thousand.

## 2. THE INFINITUDE OF THE NUMBER SYSTEM. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION

### What is the simplest example to describe the mathematical infinite?

It is infinite sequence of integers.

> There is no end to the sequence of integers 1, 2, 3, 4, • • • ; for after any integer n has been reached we may write the next integer, n + 1. We express this property of the sequence of integers by saying that there are infinitely many integers. 
>
> The sequence of integers represents the simplest and most natural example of the mathematical infinite, which plays a dominant role in modern mathematics. Everywhere in this book we shall have to deal with collections or “sets" containing infinitely many mathematical objects, like the set of all points on a line or the set of all triangles in a plane. The infinite sequence of integers is the simplest example of an infinite set.

### What is "Empirical induction"?

> "Empirical induction" in the natural sciences proceeds from a particular series of observations of a certain phenomenon to the statement of a general law governing all occurrences of this phenomenon. The degree of certainty with which the law is thereby established depends on the number of single observations and confirmations. This sort of inductive reasoning is often entirely **convincing**; the prediction that the sun will rise tomorrow in the east is as certain as anything can be, but the character of this statement is not the same as that of a theorem proved by strict logical or mathematical reasoning.
>
> > Convincing
> >
> > 1 a convincing argument: cogent, persuasive, plausible, powerful, potent, strong, forceful, compelling, irresistible, telling, conclusive.
> >
> > 2 a convincing 5–0 win: resounding, emphatic, decisive, conclusive.
>
> 只能说是“有说服力”，而不够“确定”。

### What is "Mathematical induction"?

> The step by step procedure of passing from n to n + 1 which generates the infinite sequence of integers also forms the basis of one of the most fundamental patterns of mathematical reasoning, the principle of mathematical induction.
>
> In quite a different way mathematical inditetion is used to establish the truth of a mathematical theorem for an infinite sequence of cases, the first, the second, the third, and so on without exception.
>
> Let us denote by A a statement that involves an arbitrary integer n. To prove such a theorem for *every* integer *n* it does not suffice to prove it separately for the first 10 or 100 or even 1000 values of n. This indeed would <u>correspond</u> to the attitude of empirical induction.

> For the case a = 0, d = 1, this is equivalent to (1).

![](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tKfTcly1fl93tfq87cj318203874w.jpg)

Ordinarily this is shown by writiing the sum `1 + 2 + 3 + … + n` in two forms:

![](https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tKfTcly1fl93v0238xj317a08wgms.jpg)

On adding, we see that each pair of numbers in the same column yields the sum `n + 1`, and, since there are `n`column in all, it follows that

which proves the desired result.

### It should be remarked that although the principle of mathematical induction suffices to prove the formula (5) once this formula has been written down, the proof gives no indication of how this formula was arrived at in the first place; why precisely the expression [n(n + 1)/2]^2 should be guessed as an expression for the sum of the first n cubes, rather than [n(n + 1)/3]^2 or (19n^2 - 41n + 24)/2 or any of the infinitely many expressions of a similar type that could have been considered?

> The fact that the proof of a theorem consists in the application of certain simple rules of logic does not dispose of the creative element in mathematics, which lies in the choice of the possibilities to be examined. The question of the origin of the hypothesis (5) belongs to a domain in which no very general rules can be given; **experiment, analogy, and constructive intuition** play their part here. 
>
> But once the correct *hypothesis* is formulated, the principle of mathematical induction is often sufficient to provide the proof. <u>Inasmuch</u> as such a proof does not give a clue to the act of discovery, it might more fittingly be called a *verification*.
