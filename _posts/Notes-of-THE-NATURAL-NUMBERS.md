I have started to read *What is Mathematics - An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods*  for three days. I would like to remember what I have learned, and mark what I have done in the exercises.

## INTRODUCTION

### What is the basis of modern mathematics?

It is number, more concisely, positive integers - the natural numbers. 

We have learned the mechanics of handling fractions and negative numbers in elemenary school, but what dose it mean to say that
$$
\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2}  \doteq 1,\  \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}, \ and \ (-1)(-1) = 1\  ?
$$
If we want to get a real understand, we should go to more elementary elements.

> While the Greeks chose the geometrical concepts of point and line as the basis of their mathematics, it has become the modem guiding principle that all mathematical statements should be reducible ultimately to statements about the natural numbers , 1, 2, 3, … .

It is a "should be", whick means a point of view.

It has argument in this point of view. 

> He criticized [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor)'s work on [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and was quoted by [Weber (1893)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker#CITEREFWeber1893)as having said, "*Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk*" ("God made the integers, all else is the work of man.").

**[Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory)** devoted primarily to the study of the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer). It might be doubted to be called "The Queen of Mathematics" because of its foundational place in the discipline. But it is indeed natural to understand mathematics.
