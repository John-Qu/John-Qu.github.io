Here is my reading notes for Chapter 0 PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGE in Prof. Guttag's book *Introduction to compuation and programming using Python*.

## Who are the students this course aimed at?

> This course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving.

Which means:

- They are not major in CS, because students who applies for CS mostly or entirely have prior experience with programming in high school even in elementary school.

  Me too.

- They have other interests, because students who are accepted by MIT mostly or entirely are eccentric somehow, time that not spend on programming must have been pound on other activities.

  Me too. Ur…, on superficial reading stories.

- They commit that computational approaches can and must be used to help problem solving, otherwise they don't need to be in this course.

  I want to solve the B-spline CAM curve problem.

## What if the students have finished this course?

> Each year, a few of the students in the class use the course as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses. But for most of the students it will be their only computer science course.

In fact, they have their own major course. Only a few of them choose to take more advanced course in CS.

> The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what’s possible when the time comes to think about how to use computation to accomplish a goal. That said, it is not a “computation appreciation” course. It is a challenging and rigorous course in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to **bend the computer** to their will.

The keywords is "possible", "appreciation" and "bend".

- Possible: no known, no possibility, not really known, no use.
- Appreciation vs Bend, not to know what computation can help and admire it, but to let this tall man bend his back and word for host's will.  

## What if the students have finished this book?

> The main goal of this book is to help you, the reader, become skillful at making productive use of computational techniques. 
>
> You should learn
>
> - to apply computational modes of thoughts to frame problems and 
> - to guide the process of extracting information from data in a computational manner. 
>
> The primary knowledge you will take away from this book is the art of computational problem solving.

Ask myself: 

- To become skillful at making productive use of computational techniques, is my goal, isn't it?
- What is my mode of thinking in framing problem? Is it computational?
- How to guild the process of extracting information from data? What is the compuatational manner?
- Did I get the primary gem after finishing this page, this chapter and this book? What is it, art of compuational problem solving? Knowing the rules and Using them as habit?

## Is there an easier way to learn programming?

> Programming is an intrinsically difficult activity. Just as “there is no royal road to geometry,” There is no royal road to programming. 
>
> It is possible to deceive students into thinking that they have learned how to program by having them complete a series of highly constrained “fill in the blank” programming problems. 
>
> However, this does not prepare students for figuring out how to harness computational thinking to solve problems.

Fill in the blank, repeat the action, not worry about copying, they are deceive to oneself.

To harness particular thinking to particular actions, there is no royal road. One must read the information, run the examples, and practice the exercises.

## Who helped John Guttag make this course and book available?

Eric Grimson,  who is MIT's Chancellor at that time, managed to find the time to read almost the entire book, found errors, pointed out places where necessary explanations were missing.

Chris Terman, read and point out errors.

David Guttag, his son might be, overcame his aversion to computer science, and proofread some chapters.

Also, teaching assistants, and students, helped a lot.
