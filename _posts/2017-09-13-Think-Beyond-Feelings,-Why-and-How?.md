I heard that it is most important in one's lift to make choice. Problem solving and acting efficiently are important, which are what we have been taught in our formal growth. However, they failed to educate how to make decisions in choosing colledge major, city to live, marriage mate, time and place to buy a house, how to invest money, career route, and roll in family life. I am lucky to make some good ones with the help of my families, but not so wise in choosing major and making money. Now I'm on the cross road choosing a new way of life, so it is most important not to miss Prof. Ruggiero's *Beryond Feelings - A Guide to Critical Thinking* again, which I had bought from senior shoal mate at Dalian but abandoned to library at Shanghai.

## What kind of book is it?

It is a practical book. Although with some declaration knowledge in cicolodgy, this book tries to persuade us to think beyond feelings with a clear strategy in the complicated context filling with mistakens and pitfalls.

Reading a practical book means, if I agree with the author's arguments, I should practice his advises. Agreeing is not enough. It's happy to have applications actions as homework at the end of each chapters. Also, I have my own issues to dig, so there will be several arguments along with or after reading this book.

## What is my road map?
